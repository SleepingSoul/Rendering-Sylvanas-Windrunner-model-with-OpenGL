Hello!
--------------------------------------

In this project i will render Sylvanas Windrunner 3D model via OpenGL.
Also i will create a FPS camera simulation for convenient reviewing of it.
For the better and more beautifull result i will create few light casters.

For this task i will use assimp library for importing the obj model into CPU;
glad, glfw3 for OpenGL.
